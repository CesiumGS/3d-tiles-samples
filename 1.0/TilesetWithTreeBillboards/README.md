# Tileset with tree billboards
## Description
The tileset contains two tiles, one `.i3dm` with full 3D trees, and another `.i3dm` with 2D billboard trees. When zooming out, the 3D trees are replaced by billboards.

Note: the billboard effect is coded into the i3dm's embedded glTF model, but a similar effect can be achieved with a vector tile.

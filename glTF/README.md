# Samples for glTF extensions 

The following is a list of samples for different glTF extensions that are supported by Cesium. Each directory contains a dedicated `.gltf` file that contains the actual glTF asset. Additionally, each directory also contains a simple `tileset.json` file that is a [3D Tiles](https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles) tileset which just contains the respective glTF asset as its only content. These tilesets can be viewed in CesiumJS, by hosting the base directory of this repository on a local server.

### `EXT_mesh_features`

The [`EXT_mesh_features`](https://github.com/CesiumGS/glTF/tree/3d-tiles-next/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_mesh_features) extension is a glTF 2.0 extension that allows identifying geometry or subcomponents of geometry in glTF 2.0 assets as individual 'features', by associating them with a feature ID.

The sandcastle code for viewing the `EXT_mesh_features` samples is shown in [glTF-Mesh-Features-Samples-Sandcastle.js](glTF-Mesh-Features-Samples-Sandcastle.js)

| Sample | Screenshot |
|:---|:--:|
| [`FeatureIdAttribute`](EXT_mesh_features/FeatureIdAttribute/)<br/> Uses an attribute of a mesh primitive to assign feature IDs to vertices | <img src="EXT_mesh_features/FeatureIdAttribute/screenshot/FeatureIdAttribute.gif" width="300">
| [`FeatureIdTexture`](EXT_mesh_features/FeatureIdTexture/)<br/> Uses a feature ID texture to assign feature IDs to texels on the surface of the geometry | <img src="EXT_mesh_features/FeatureIdTexture/screenshot/FeatureIdTexture.gif" width="300">


### `EXT_structural_metadata`

The [`EXT_structural_metadata`](https://github.com/CesiumGS/glTF/tree/3d-tiles-next/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_structural_metadata) extension is a glTF 2.0 extension that allows storing structured metadata in glTF 2.0 assets in the form of _property tables_. Together with the [`EXT_mesh_features`](https://github.com/CesiumGS/glTF/tree/3d-tiles-next/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_mesh_features) extension, the metadata can be looked up in these tables, using the feature IDs. 

The sandcastle code for viewing the `EXT_structural_metadata` samples is shown in [glTF-Structural-Metadata-Samples-Sandcastle.js](glTF-Structural-Metadata-Samples-Sandcastle.js)


| Sample | Screenshot |
|:---|:--:|
| [`FeatureIdAttributeAndPropertyTable`](EXT_structural_metadata/FeatureIdAttributeAndPropertyTable/)<br/> Vertices that are associated with properties that are stored in a property table | <img src="EXT_structural_metadata/FeatureIdAttributeAndPropertyTable/screenshot/FeatureIdAttributeAndPropertyTable.png" width="300">
| [`FeatureIdTextureAndPropertyTable`](EXT_structural_metadata/FeatureIdTextureAndPropertyTable/)<br/> Texels that are associated with properties that are stored in a property table | <img src="EXT_structural_metadata/FeatureIdTextureAndPropertyTable/screenshot/FeatureIdTextureAndPropertyTable.gif" width="300">
| [`MultipleFeatureIdsAndProperties`](EXT_structural_metadata/MultipleFeatureIdsAndProperties/)<br/> Multiple feature ID sets that are associated with metadata containing multiple properties | <img src="EXT_structural_metadata/MultipleFeatureIdsAndProperties/screenshot/MultipleFeatureIdsAndProperties.gif" width="300">
| [`SharedPropertyTable`](EXT_structural_metadata/SharedPropertyTable/)<br/> Two mesh primitives that define feature IDs, where both refer to the same property table | <img src="EXT_structural_metadata/SharedPropertyTable/screenshot/SharedPropertyTable.png" width="300">
| [`MultipleClasses`](EXT_structural_metadata/MultipleClasses/)<br/> Two mesh primitives that define feature IDs, where both refer to the same property table | <img src="EXT_structural_metadata/MultipleClasses/screenshot/MultipleClasses.gif" width="300">
| [`ComplexTypes`](EXT_structural_metadata/ComplexTypes/)<br/> Features that contain properties with more complex types | <img src="EXT_structural_metadata/ComplexTypes/screenshot/ComplexTypes.png" width="300">
| [`SimplePropertyTexture`](EXT_structural_metadata/SimplePropertyTexture/)<br/> Properties that are stored in a texture | <img src="EXT_structural_metadata/SimplePropertyTexture/screenshot/SimplePropertyTexture.gif" width="300">
| [`PropertyAttributesPointCloud`](EXT_structural_metadata/PropertyAttributesPointCloud/)<br/> Properties that are stored in vertex attributes, contained in a 3D Tiles tileset that contains statistics for the metadata values. | <img src="EXT_structural_metadata/PropertyAttributesPointCloud/screenshot/PropertyAttributesPointCloud.gif" width="300">


### Other glTF extensions

| Sample | Screenshot |
|:---|:--:|
| [`GpuInstancesMetadata`](GpuInstancesMetadata/)<br/> An example that uses `EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing` to create GPU instances that are associated with feature IDs, which are used for looking up metadata in a property table | <img src="GpuInstancesMetadata/screenshot/GpuInstancesMetadata.gif" width="300">
